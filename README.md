# Regen Agri FHE: A DePIN Network for Regenerative Agriculture 🌱🔒

Regen Agri FHE is a groundbreaking project designed to empower farmers by securely tracking regenerative agriculture practices through **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology (FHE)**. By leveraging FHE, this platform ensures that sensitive environmental data is protected while enabling financial opportunities for farmers through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

## Understanding the Challenge

Agriculture faces significant challenges today, including the need for sustainable practices that contribute to environmental health. Farmers often collect valuable data, such as soil carbon emissions, which can be instrumental in fostering regenerative agriculture. However, the lack of privacy and trust in data sharing limits the ability of farmers to utilize this information effectively in financial ecosystems, where it could otherwise be transformed into valuable environmental assets.

## The FHE-Powered Solution

Regen Agri addresses these challenges by implementing **Zama's FHE technology**, which allows farmers to collect and encrypt their soil data through Deployment of IoT sensors (DePIN). This encrypted data remains confidential while still being usable for calculations and analyses, significantly enhancing privacy while maintaining trust across the agricultural finance landscape. Using Zama's open-source libraries, like **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, the platform quantifies environmental contributions without exposing sensitive information.

## Key Features

- **DePIN Sensor Integration**: Farmers can deploy sensors that collect critical soil data, which is then encrypted using FHE and uploaded to the Regen Agri network.
- **Environmental Asset Creation**: The encrypted soil data can be translated into “environmental assets” that farmers can leverage for loans or rewards in DeFi protocols, promoting regenerative agriculture practices.
- **Homomorphic Quantification**: Effortlessly quantify environmental contributions through encrypted computation, ensuring secure processing of sensitive data.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Farmers can access a comprehensive data dashboard for enhanced visibility of their environmental data and interactions with ReFi protocols.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The core component for confidential computing.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript execution for handling business logic.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: Development environments for Ethereum blockchain.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing agricultural data securely.

## Installation Guide

To get started with the Regen Agri FHE project, follow the steps below to set up your environment:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.
2. Install **Hardhat** or **Foundry** for Ethereum development.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to install dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

> **Important**: Do NOT use `git clone` or any URLs to download this project.

## Build & Run Guide

Once your environment is set up, you can build and run the Regen Agri project with the following commands:

1. **Compile Smart Contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy Smart Contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <your_network>
   ```

Make sure to replace `<your_network>` with the network you wish to deploy your contracts to (e.g., localhost, rinkeby).
